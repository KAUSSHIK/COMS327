                                                            1. make
                                                            2. make run (or ./pc_and_trainers --numtrainers x  ,  if you want to specify the switch)
                                                            3. make clean
                                                            

In this fourth iteration of the Pok√©mon game that we are building, we implemnted the MOVEMENTS for the trainers

So in the professors version of the code, I was able to create a new function that places the player character (PC) and all the other NPCs on the map

IN THE OUTPUT player characters position is represented by '@' and the others are same as defined, you can enter --numtrainers to see how it works.

FOR NOW THE CODE WILL KEEP PRINTING THE MOTION of all charcters, but now I did not know how to also include the code to move around maps but sicne that was not part of the requiremnt i hope i get the benefit of the doubt

ADDED COLOR to make it look appealing and easy to see
