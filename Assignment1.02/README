My map contains all needed features
Malloc errors seem to happen often and code from assignment 1.01 also seems to break in between for reasons I do not know.
Extremely sorry for the late submission, I was not able to complete the assignment on time since
I was suffering from a bad fever and was not able to work on the assignment for the past 2 days. Did preliminary covid checks just in case.
Will not repeat this again.

I will make a rough submission now and hope to get it fixed by wednesday if that is okay.
