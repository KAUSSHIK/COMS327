In this eigth iteration of the Pok√©mon game that we are building, we implemnted the pokemon genration

So in the professors version of the code, I was able to reintroduce a new file pokemon.cpp that was responsible for making the pokemon and modified the io.cpp to choose pokemon when starting

Made necessary fuctions to place pokemon so they can be discoverd whern walking through the maps

IN THE OUTPUT we can see the messages that show the discovery of pokemon

i am using the locally stored DB in HOME/.poke327

Thank you.
