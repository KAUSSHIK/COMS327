                                                            1. make
                                                            2. ./poke327 <name of csv file you want to print without .csv extension>
                                                            3. make clean
                                                            

In this sevfenth iteration of the Pok√©mon game that we are building, we implemnted the CSV PARSING from map to map

So in the professors version of the code, I was able to reintroduce a new .cpp program that reads the given file when passed in as a CL Argument

IN THE OUTPUT we can see the contents of the csv file taht we passed in as a command line argument

i am using the locally stored DB in HOME/.poke327

Thank you.
